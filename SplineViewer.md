To enable loading Spline scenes on your site, go to Site Settings -> General in your Framer project and paste the following code into the "Start of \<head> tag" code box under Custom Code:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer/build/spline-viewer.js"></script>
```

This code loads the official Spline Viewer script, which enables loading Spline scenes on any site. To learn more about Spline Viewer, visit [viewer.spline.design](https://viewer.spline.design).

**Note:** Spline scenes only load on published sites. In the Framer site editor and preview, the scene will not be visible.
